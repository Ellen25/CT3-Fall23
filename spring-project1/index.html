      <h1>1. Interesting API Findings</h1>
      <p>#1 NASA Meteorite Landing Database</p>
      <p>NASA has been kept updating data about meteorite landings throughout the human history in its <a href="https://data.nasa.gov/Space-Science/Meteorite-Landings/gh4g-9sfh/about_data">Meteorit-Landing</a> Open Data Portal. The database contains information about all the meteorite landings throughout history. </p>
      <p>#2 Rap World Artist</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/rapworld/table/?location=4,27.87793,95.05371&basemap=jawg.streets">Rap World Artist</a> dataset contains information about 581 rappers/rap groups/other artists in the rap area, and had a visualization based on the where they grew up or the place that has significant impact to them.</p>

      <p>I found it interesting to see how diverse and how enormous that APIs can contain. And a lot of freedom and blank space could be filled and played with among different categories. Therefore, what if we view the variety of APIs as a whole and play with its massiveness, power, lengthiness, and density.</p>
      <p>That is to say, I would like to create a ridiculous interactive game based on the format of Mad-Libs poems, where people can keep generating random words coming from various APIs. People can set the category or the tag of the words they would like to generate. The more number of words one tries to generate, the more chaotic the page would become. And finally, the poem would become a messy bunch of words filled with hilarious but ridiculous phrases.</p>
